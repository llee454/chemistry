    orbits. Sommerfield, extended this model to include eliptical
    orbits. This function uses a variant of the Bohr-Sommerfield
    model.

    Note: [z] can be written as [z - s] to reflect the idea of
    "shielding." In the Bohr-Sommerfield model, an electron can be
    partially shielded from the nucleus by other electrons that are
    in orbits closer to the nucleus than it. We subtract 1 from z
    for every electron that fully shields an outer electron. Certain
    outer orbits however can "penetrate" within inner orbits. When
    this happens the shielding constant s will be less than one.

  we can:
  1. assign unshared electrons to individual atoms
  2. place zero or more covalent bonds (shared pairs of electrons) between two atoms.

  Every atom is described by two properties:
  1. the number of valence electrons (the number of electrons in its outermost/"valence" shell)
  2. its electronegativity

  We use a symmetric matrix to count the number of shared electrons between each pair of atoms.

  [
    [y_{0,0}, y_{0,1}, ..., y_{0,n-1}],
    [y_{1,0}, y_{1,1}, ..., y_{1,n-1}],
    ...
    [y_{n-1,0}, y_{n-1,1}, ..., y_{n-1,n-1}],
  ]

  The matrix is symmetric so the y_{i,j} = y_{j,i} for all i and j. Also, we assume that all diagonal elements y_{i,i} represent the number of unshared electrons that we assign to the ith atom.

  Because the matrix is symmetric, we only consider the top right triangular entries. These can be listed in a single vector as:

  [y_{0,0}, y_{0,1}, ..., y_{0,n-1}, y_{1,1}, ... y{1,n-1}, ..., y{n-1,n-1}]

  We call this vector the "electron configuration vector".

  Given an "electron configuration vector," we can compute the charge on each atom. For each atom a_i, we calculate m_i, the number of unshared electrons and covalent bonds involving a_i and then compute:

    sum (ionic (a_i.electronegativity - a_j.electronegativity), j, n-1) - (m - a_i.num_valence_electrons)

  where ionic (x, y) returns the degree to which an electron will favor an electron with electronegativity x over y. 

  We use a genetic algorithm to find an electron configuration that minimizes the charge across atoms.
