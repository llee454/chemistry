    Note: Bohr, modeled the electron orbits using circular
    orbits. Sommerfield, extended this model to include eliptical
    orbits. This function uses a variant of the Bohr-Sommerfield
    model.

    Note: [z] can be written as [z - s] to reflect the idea of
    "shielding." In the Bohr-Sommerfield model, an electron can be
    partially shielded from the nucleus by other electrons that are
    in orbits closer to the nucleus than it. We subtract 1 from z
    for every electron that fully shields an outer electron. Certain
    outer orbits however can "penetrate" within inner orbits. When
    this happens the shielding constant s will be less than one.

    WARNING: in [1] Pauling gives a value of 2.02 Å for the unit test
